# 1.3. Jenkins Installation

## 1.3.1. Install Jenkins on various environments (Docker, Windows, Linux, Kubernetes)

### 1. Install Jenkins with Docker

- **Link:** https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/README.md

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up Jenkins on Host Docker using the method of sharing the host's Docker socket. This way, Jenkins can manage Docker containers directly on the host.

### **1. Install Docker on Your EC2 Instance (if not already installed)**

First, make sure Docker is installed on your EC2 instance. If it's not installed, follow these steps:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

To check if Docker is running correctly:

```bash
sudo docker --version
sudo docker ps
```

### **2. Run Jenkins as a Docker Container**

Now, we will run Jenkins inside a Docker container, but this container will have access to the host's Docker daemon. This allows Jenkins to manage other containers without the need for Docker-in-Docker.

Run Jenkins with the following command:

- Without Jenkins Agent

```bash
sudo docker run \
  -d \
  --name jenkins \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /var/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk17
```

- With Jenkins Agent

```bash
sudo docker run \
  -d \
  --name jenkins \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 50000:50000 \
  -v /var/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk17
```

Explanation of the options:

- `-p 8080:8080`: Maps port 8080 of the host to Jenkins' UI.
- `-p 50000:50000`: This is used for Jenkins agents (if you use them).
- `-v /var/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home`: This binds the Jenkins home directory to the host for data persistence.
- `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`: This shares the Docker socket with the Jenkins container, allowing it to run Docker commands on the host.

#### Giving Required Permissions

The error messages you're seeing indicate that Jenkins is unable to write to the `JENKINS_HOME` directory, which is mapped to `/var/jenkins_home` on your host machine. This is typically due to permission issues on the host directory.

##### Steps to Fix the Permission Issue

1. **Check Current Permissions**:
   First, check the permissions of the `/var/jenkins_home` directory on the host:

   ```bash
   ls -ld /var/jenkins_home
   ```

2. **Change Ownership**:
   The Jenkins container runs as a non-root user by default (usually `jenkins` with UID 1000). To allow Jenkins to write to its home directory, you can change the ownership of the directory to the `jenkins` user:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /var/jenkins_home
   ```

3. **Set Correct Permissions**:
   If needed, you can also adjust the permissions to ensure the `jenkins` user has read and write access:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/jenkins_home
   ```

4. **Restart the Jenkins Container**: **(Very Imp)**
   After changing the permissions and ownership, restart the Jenkins container:

   ```bash
   sudo docker restart jenkins
   ```

5. **Verify Logs Again**:
   Check the logs again to see if Jenkins starts correctly:
   ```bash
   sudo docker logs jenkins
   ```

### **3. Access Jenkins**

Once Jenkins is running, you can access the Jenkins UI at `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080`.

You will be prompted for an initial admin password, which you can find inside the Jenkins container:

```bash
docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Copy that password, and paste it into the Jenkins setup wizard.

### **4. Install Docker in Jenkins**

After accessing the Jenkins UI:

1. Install the **"Docker"** and **"Docker Pipeline"** plugins:

   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** -> **Manage Plugins** -> **Available** tab.
   - Search for "Docker" and "Docker Pipeline" plugins and install them.

2. Restart Jenkins after the plugins are installed.

### **5. Create a Jenkins Pipeline to Manage Your Application**

Now, you can create a Jenkins pipeline to build, pull the latest code, and run `docker-compose` commands.

1. **Create a new Pipeline job** in Jenkins:

   - Go to **New Item** -> Enter a name (e.g., "App-CI-CD") -> Choose **Pipeline** and click **OK**.

2. **Configure the Pipeline** with a `Jenkinsfile`:
   In the "Pipeline" section, you can either:
   - Write your pipeline directly in the Jenkins UI, or
   - Use a `Jenkinsfile` in your repository.

A sample `Jenkinsfile` that pulls the latest code and manages the `docker-compose` setup could look like this:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Clone Repository') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-repo/app.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Stop Existing Containers') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker-compose down'
            }
        }
        stage('Pull New Images') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker-compose pull'
            }
        }
        stage('Start Application') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker-compose up -d'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **6. Test the Pipeline**

Once the pipeline is created:

- Click **Build Now** to trigger the job.
- Jenkins will pull the latest code from your repository, stop the current application, and restart it with the new code.

### **7. Automate Builds with Webhooks**

To trigger Jenkins builds automatically when you push code to your repository:

1. Set up a **webhook** in your Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to notify Jenkins of new commits.
2. In Jenkins, you can configure the job to listen for these webhooks by setting up the **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling** in your job configuration.
