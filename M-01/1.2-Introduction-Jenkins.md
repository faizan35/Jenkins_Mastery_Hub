# 1.2 Introduction to Jenkins

## Historical Background:

- Jenkins, initially known as **Hudson**, was created by Kohsuke Kawaguchi in 2004.
- It emerged as an open-source automation server designed for Continuous Integration (CI) purposes.
- The project gained significant traction due to its flexibility, extensibility, and active community support.
- Over time, **Jenkins became one of the most popular CI/CD tools**, widely adopted by organizations of all sizes and across various industries.

## Overview of Jenkins Architecture:

Jenkins follows a **master-slave architecture**,

**Key components of Jenkins architecture include:**

- **Master Node:** Manages the Jenkins environment, **schedules** build jobs, and monitors the execution of tasks.
- **Slave Nodes (Agents):** **Execute** build jobs delegated by the master node. Multiple slave nodes can be configured to handle concurrent builds and different types of workloads.
- **Executor:** Represents a thread or process on a slave node, responsible for executing a specific build job.
- **Job/Project:** Represents a specific task or workflow, such as compiling code, running tests, or deploying applications.

This distributed architecture allows Jenkins to **scale horizontally**, accommodating larger workloads and improving resource utilization.

#### Exploring Key Features and Functionalities:

Jenkins offers a wide range of features to support Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) workflows:

1.  **Pipeline Support:** Jenkins supports defining CI/CD pipelines as code using the **Jenkinsfile** syntax. This allows teams to version control their pipelines alongside their application code, promoting consistency and repeatability.

2.  **Integration with Version Control Systems (VCS):** Jenkins seamlessly integrates with popular version control systems like Git, SVN, and Mercurial. It can automatically trigger builds upon code commits or pull requests, enabling rapid feedback loops.

3.  **Extensive Plugin Ecosystem:** Jenkins boasts a vast ecosystem of plugins, offering integrations with various tools and technologies. Plugins cover areas such as SCM integration, build tools, testing frameworks, deployment options, and more. This extensibility allows users to tailor Jenkins to their specific requirements.

4.  **Distributed Builds:** Jenkins supports distributed builds, allowing users to distribute workload across multiple slave nodes. This improves build performance, scalability, and resource utilization, particularly in large-scale CI/CD environments.

5.  **Build Pipelines and Workflows:** Jenkins enables the creation of complex build pipelines and workflows, consisting of multiple stages and tasks. Users can define sequential or parallel execution of tasks, incorporate conditional logic, and handle error recovery, providing flexibility in defining CI/CD processes.
