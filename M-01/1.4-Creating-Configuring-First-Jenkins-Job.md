# 1.4 Creating and Configuring Your First Jenkins Job

#### Setting up a Basic Jenkins Job:

Creating a Jenkins job involves defining a task or workflow that Jenkins will execute as part of the Continuous Integration (CI) or Continuous Delivery (CD) process. Here's how you can set up your first Jenkins job:

1.  **Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard:** After logging in to Jenkins, you'll land on the Jenkins dashboard.
2.  **Click on "New Item":** On the left sidebar, click on "New Item" to create a new job.
3.  **Enter Job Name:** Give your job a descriptive name that reflects its purpose. Choose the appropriate job type (e.g., Freestyle project, Pipeline) based on your requirements.
4.  **Configure General Settings:** In the job configuration page, you can configure general settings such as description, discard old builds, and parameters (if needed).
5.  **Configure Source Code Management (SCM):** If your job involves working with source code, you'll need to configure the SCM settings to specify the repository URL, credentials (if required), and branches to build.
6.  **Define Build Triggers:** Build triggers determine when Jenkins should start a build for the job. Common triggers include SCM changes, scheduled builds, or manual triggers. Configure the appropriate trigger(s) based on your workflow.
7.  **Configure Build Steps:** Define the build steps that Jenkins should execute as part of the job. This may include compiling code, running tests, packaging artifacts, or deploying applications. Jenkins provides various build steps and build tools integration options to accommodate different requirements.
8.  **Post-Build Actions:** Optionally, you can configure post-build actions to perform tasks after the build completes, such as archiving artifacts, triggering downstream jobs, or sending notifications.
9.  **Save and Run:** Once you've configured the job settings, save the configuration changes. You can manually trigger the job by clicking on "Build Now" to initiate a build, or Jenkins will automatically trigger the job based on the configured build triggers.
10. **Monitor Build Results:** Monitor the build progress and results in the Jenkins dashboard. Jenkins provides detailed build logs, test reports, and status indicators to help you track the status of your job.

By following these steps, you can create your first Jenkins job and configure it to perform the desired tasks as part of your CI/CD workflow.
