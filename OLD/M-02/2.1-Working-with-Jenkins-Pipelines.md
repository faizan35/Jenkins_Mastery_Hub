# 2.1 Working with Jenkins Pipelines

## Understanding Declarative vs. Scripted Pipelines:

Jenkins pipelines allow you to define your Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) workflows as code. There are two primary syntaxes for defining Jenkins pipelines: Declarative and Scripted.

1.  **Declarative Pipeline:**

    - Declarative pipelines offer a simplified and opinionated syntax for defining pipelines.
    - They use a structured DSL (Domain-Specific Language) and define the entire pipeline in a single block.
    - Declarative pipelines are designed to be easy to read, write, and maintain, making them suitable for beginners and standard use cases.
    - They provide a more limited set of features compared to Scripted pipelines but offer a more concise and declarative approach.

2.  **Scripted Pipeline:**

    - Scripted pipelines allow for more flexibility and control over the pipeline definition.
    - They use Groovy scripting language syntax to define the pipeline, allowing for conditional logic, loops, and access to Jenkins' internal APIs.
    - Scripted pipelines are suitable for complex workflows that require advanced customization or integration with external systems.
    - They offer a more imperative programming style, where each step in the pipeline is explicitly defined using Groovy script.

## Creating and Managing Pipeline Jobs:

To create and manage pipeline jobs in Jenkins:

1.  **Creating a Pipeline Job:**

    - Navigate to the Jenkins dashboard and click on "New Item."
    - Enter a name for your pipeline job and select "Pipeline" as the job type.
    - Click "OK" to create the job.

2.  **Defining Pipeline Script:**

    - In the job configuration page, you'll define the pipeline script using either Declarative or Scripted syntax.
    - For Declarative pipelines, you'll define stages and steps within a `pipeline` block.
    - For Scripted pipelines, you'll use Groovy script syntax to define the pipeline steps.

3.  **Managing Pipeline Jobs:**

    - Once the pipeline job is created, you can trigger builds manually or automatically based on configured triggers.
    - You can view build history, monitor build progress, and access build artifacts from the Jenkins dashboard.
    - Jenkins provides options for configuring build triggers, post-build actions, and integration with version control systems.

## Writing Jenkinsfiles to Define Pipeline Stages and Steps:

Jenkinsfiles are used to define pipeline workflows in Jenkins. They are text files that contain the pipeline script, either in Declarative or Scripted syntax. Here's an overview of writing Jenkinsfiles:

1.  **Syntax Elements:**

    - Jenkinsfiles consist of stages, steps, and directives.
    - Stages represent logical divisions of the pipeline (e.g., build, test, deploy), while steps define individual actions within each stage (e.g., checkout code, compile, test).

2.  **Declarative Syntax Example:**

    ```groovy
    pipeline {
        agent any
        stages {
            stage('Build') {
                steps {
                    // Define build steps here
                }
            }
            stage('Test') {
                steps {
                    // Define test steps here
                }
            }
            // Add more stages as needed
        }
        // Add post-build actions, notifications, etc.
    }
    ```

3.  **Scripted Syntax Example:**

    ```groovy
    node {
        stage('Build') {
            // Define build steps here
        }
        stage('Test') {
            // Define test steps here
        }
        // Add more stages as needed
    }
    ```

By writing Jenkinsfiles, you can version control your pipeline configurations, promote collaboration, and ensure repeatability and consistency in your CI/CD workflows.
