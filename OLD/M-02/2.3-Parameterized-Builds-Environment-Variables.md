# 2.3 Parameterized Builds and Environment Variables

#### Defining Parameters for Builds:

Parameterized builds allow you to customize the behavior of your Jenkins jobs by defining parameters that users can specify when triggering a build. Here's how you can define parameters for your builds:

1.  **Navigate to Job Configuration:** Open the configuration page of your Jenkins job.
2.  **Enable Parameterized Build:** Check the option to "This project is parameterized" to enable parameterized builds.
3.  **Add Parameter Types:** Jenkins supports various parameter types, including:

    - **String Parameter:** Allows users to input a string value.
    - **Boolean Parameter:** Provides a checkbox for users to select true or false.
    - **Choice Parameter:** Presents users with a dropdown menu of predefined choices.
    - **File Parameter:** Allows users to upload a file as a parameter.
    - **...and more**: Jenkins offers additional parameter types for different use cases.

4.  **Configure Parameter Details:** Specify a name and description for each parameter. For choice parameters, define the list of choices. You can also set default values and mark parameters as required.
5.  **Use Parameters in Build Steps:** Once parameters are defined, you can access their values in your build steps using environment variables (e.g., `${PARAM_NAME}`). This allows you to customize the behavior of your build based on user inputs.

#### Passing and Using Environment Variables in Jenkins Jobs:

Environment variables provide a way to pass information between different parts of your Jenkins job, including between build steps and across different stages of a pipeline. Here's how you can work with environment variables in Jenkins:

1.  **Predefined Environment Variables:** Jenkins provides a set of predefined environment variables that are automatically available in every build, such as `BUILD_NUMBER`, `JOB_NAME`, and `WORKSPACE`. These variables contain information about the current build environment.
2.  **Custom Environment Variables:** You can define custom environment variables within your Jenkins job configuration or pipeline script. These variables can store values such as paths, URLs, or configuration settings that are used by your build steps.
3.  **Accessing Environment Variables:** Environment variables can be accessed within your build steps using shell scripting syntax (e.g., `$VAR_NAME` in Unix-like shells or `%VAR_NAME%` in Windows batch scripts). You can also use Groovy syntax to access environment variables in scripted pipelines.
4.  **Using Environment Variables in Parameterized Builds:** Environment variables can be used to populate parameter values in parameterized builds. This allows you to dynamically set parameter values based on the current build environment or other factors.

#### Dynamic Build Configurations Based on Parameters:

Parameterized builds and environment variables enable you to create dynamic build configurations that adapt to different scenarios and user inputs. Here are some examples of dynamic build configurations:

1.  **Branch-specific Builds:** Use a choice parameter to allow users to select a branch for the build. Then, use the selected branch as an environment variable to check out the corresponding code and perform the build.
2.  **Environment-specific Configurations:** Define environment-specific variables (e.g., URLs, credentials) as parameters. Use these variables to configure the build process differently for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
3.  **Conditional Build Steps:** Use environment variables to conditionally execute build steps based on certain criteria. For example, you can skip certain steps if a specific parameter is not provided or if a certain condition is met.

By leveraging parameterized builds and environment variables, you can create flexible and customizable Jenkins jobs that adapt to different scenarios and user requirements.
